        "Nodes in networks could be organized based on communities they belong to (i.e., homophily); in other cases, the organization could be based on the structural roles of nodes in the network (i.e., structural equivalence). For instance, in the below figure, we observe nodes $u$ and $s_1$ belonging to the same tightly knit community of nodes, while the nodes $u$ and $s_6$ in the two distinct communities share the same structural role of a hub node. Real-world networks commonly exhibit a mixture of such equivalences."

        "The node2vec framework learns low-dimensional representations for nodes in a graph by optimizing a neighborhood preserving objective. The objective is flexible, and the algorithm accommodates for various definitions of network neighborhoods by simulating biased random walks. Specifically, it provides a way of balancing the exploration-exploitation tradeoff that in turn leads to representations obeying a spectrum of equivalences from homophily to structural equivalence.\n",
